\mainpage The oomph-lib download page




\section q A few quick questions...


Since <CODE>oomph-lib</CODE> is developed as open-source software,
any evidence that the code is being downloaded and used is very helpful
for us as it helps to justify our continued work on this project.

We would therefore be extremely grateful if you could provide the
information requested in the form below. Pressing the "submit" button will
get you to the actual download page.



<B>Note:</B>
<UL>
<LI> All information will be treated as confidential.
<LI> If you provide your email address and check the
appropriate box we will add you to our
mailing list to inform you of upgrades and bug fixes to the code.
Rest assured that the mailing list is <B>very low volume</B> -- we have
better things to do than to bombard you with email.
<LI> If you  still feel reluctant to provide any of the information
requested, feel free to enter some dummy input.
The form will check that <B>some</B> information has been
entered but entering your name as "Joe Cool" is perfectly acceptable
-- this is to discourage people from not providing
the information simply because they are too lazy to type...
