Since {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} is developed as open-\/source software, any evidence that the code is being downloaded and used is very helpful for us as it helps to justify our continued work on this project.

We would therefore be extremely grateful if you could provide the information requested in the form below. Pressing the \char`\"{}submit\char`\"{} button will get you to the actual download page.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All information will be treated as confidential. 
\item If you provide your email address and check the appropriate box we will add you to our mailing list to inform you of upgrades and bug fixes to the code. Rest assured that the mailing list is {\bfseries{very low volume}} -- we have better things to do than to bombard you with email. 
\item If you still feel reluctant to provide any of the information requested, feel free to enter some dummy input. The form will check that {\bfseries{some}} information has been entered but entering your name as \char`\"{}\+Joe Cool\char`\"{} is perfectly acceptable -- this is to discourage people from not providing the information simply because they are too lazy to type...
