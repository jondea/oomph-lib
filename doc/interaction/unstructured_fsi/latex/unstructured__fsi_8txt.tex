A 2D channel is partly obstructed by an odd-\/shaped elastic obstacle that deforms in response to gravity and to the traction that the fluid exerts onto it. The coupled \mbox{\hyperlink{unstructured__fsi_8txt_a559b24adf0c5fc11da2b7f8c4c406c08}{problem}} is a straightforward combination of the two single-\/physics problems shown at the top of the sketch\+:\+The flow through a channel with a rigid obstacle(shown on the top left), and the deformation of the elastic obstacle in response to a prescribed surface traction(shown on the top right).

For this purpose we non-\/dimensionalise all lengths on some reference length \textbackslash{}f\$ \{\textbackslash{}cal L\} \textbackslash{}f\$ and use the average inflow velocity, \textbackslash{}f\$ \{\textbackslash{}cal U\}\textbackslash{}f\$, to non-\/dimensionalise the velocities in the Navier-\/Stokes equations. As discussed in the$<$ a href=\char`\"{}../../../navier\+\_\+stokes/unstructured\+\_\+fluid/html/index.\+html\#reynolds\char`\"{}$>$ single-\/physics fluids tutorial,$<$/a $>$ the Reynolds number of the flow is then given by \textbackslash{}f\mbox{[}Re=\textbackslash{}frac\{\textbackslash{}rho \{\textbackslash{}cal U\} \{\textbackslash{}cal L\}\}\{\textbackslash{}mu\} \textbackslash{}, \textbackslash{}f\mbox{]} where \textbackslash{}f\$ \textbackslash{}rho \textbackslash{}f\$ and \textbackslash{}f\$ \textbackslash{}mu \textbackslash{}f\$ are the fluid density and viscosity, respectively. \textbackslash{}c oomph-\/lib \textquotesingle{}s Navier Stokes elements non-\/dimensionalise the fluid stresses, and in particular the pressure, on the viscous scale, \textbackslash{}f\$ \textbackslash{}mu \{\textbackslash{}cal U\}/\{\textbackslash{}cal L\} \textbackslash{}f\$.

For these parameter values, the structure is loaded only by gravity and does not feel the presence of the fluid, whereas the fluid flow is affected by the changes to the fluid domain when the obstacle deforms(first frame). Next, we increase the Reynolds number to \textbackslash{}f\$ Re=10\textbackslash{}f\$ and re-\/compute the solution(second frame), before increasing \textbackslash{}f\$ Q \textbackslash{}f\$ in small increments(subsequent frames). The increase in \textbackslash{}f\$ Q \textbackslash{}f\$ may be interpreted as a reduction in the obstacle \textquotesingle{}s stiffness and the animation shows clearly how this increases its flow-\/induced deformation. @I w 0.\+75\textbackslash{}textwidth flow \char`\"{}Animation of the flow field (streamlines and pressure contours) and the deformation of the elastic obstacle. \char`\"{}$<$ HR $>$$<$ HR $>$ \textbackslash{}section overview\+\_\+implementation Overview of the implementation The use of unstructured \mbox{\hyperlink{unstructured__fsi_8txt_a10c273dc7961c7f9310ceef385b621ab}{meshes}} means that the design of an algebraic node update strategy for the deforming fluid mesh, as described for$<$ a href=\char`\"{}../../fsi\+\_\+collapsible\+\_\+channel\+\_\+algebraic/html/index.\+html\char`\"{}$>$ fluid-\/structure interaction with structured \mbox{\hyperlink{unstructured__fsi_8txt_a10c273dc7961c7f9310ceef385b621ab}{meshes}},$<$/a $>$ is(almost) impossible and would, in any case, defeat the point of using automatic mesh generation tools. A slightly less efficient, but easily and generally applicable strategy is to update the nodal positions within the fluid mesh by treating the fluid domain as a pseudo-\/elastic solid.
