A read-\/only \href{http://subversion.tigris.org/}{\texttt{ subversion}} repository of the oomph-\/lib project is hosted at \href{http://oomph-lib.maths.man.ac.uk}{\texttt{ oomph-\/lib.\+maths.\+man.\+ac.\+uk}}. If \href{http://subversion.tigris.org/}{\texttt{ subversion}} is installed on your computer you can obtain the latest snapshot of the project by issuing the command


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{svn checkout svn:\textcolor{comment}{//oomph-\/lib.maths.man.ac.uk/release/trunk}}
\end{DoxyCode}


Updates to the latest version can then be obtained by


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{svn update}
\end{DoxyCode}


The location of our subversion repository has changed, if you were using the old location and you get an error that you can\textquotesingle{}t connect then (in the top-\/level directory) please issue the command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{svn relocate svn:\textcolor{comment}{//oomph-\/lib.maths.man.ac.uk/release/trunk}}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that the source tree in the subversion repository is not a working distribution and you must run


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./autogen.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


in order to build and install the library; see the \href{../../the_distribution/html/index.html}{\texttt{ installation instructions}} for further details. In addition, you must have current versions of the autotools\+: \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/}{\texttt{ automake}}, \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}{\texttt{ autoconf}} and \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/}{\texttt{ libtool}}, installed on your machine.

For information on how to obtain and use subversion please see the \href{http://subversion.tigris.org/}{\texttt{ subversion web site. }}

In addition, a browesable version of the repository is available at the access-\/controlled page ~\newline

If the response to the checkout or update commands is 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{svn: Can\textcolor{stringliteral}{'t connect to host '}oomph-\/lib.maths.man.ac.uk\textcolor{stringliteral}{': Network unreachable}}
\end{DoxyCode}
 despite the fact that your web browser is working, say, the likely problem is that your network commands are being intercepted by a proxy server, and you are using a version of the subversion software that does not have proxy settings for the svn protocol. (Subversion can also use the http and https protocols, but these are not serviced by our repository. Therefore the response to the command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{svn checkout http:\textcolor{comment}{//oomph-\/lib.maths.man.ac.uk/release/trunk }}
\end{DoxyCode}
 will be 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{svn: Server sent unexpected \textcolor{keywordflow}{return} value (400 Bad Request) in response to OPTIONS request}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{for} \textcolor{stringliteral}{'http://oomph-\/lib.maths.man.ac.uk/release/trunk'}}
\end{DoxyCode}


The solution is to install tsocks (if you don\textquotesingle{}t have it already on your computer). If you are running Ubuntu or another Debian derivative, the appropriate command is 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{apt-\/get install tsocks}
\end{DoxyCode}
 Edit the IP addresses in {\ttfamily /etc/tsocks}.conf to refer to your local domain and proxy server (you may need to ask your local network administrator for information). The checkout is then effected by issuing the command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tsocks svn checkout svn:\textcolor{comment}{//oomph-\/lib.maths.man.ac.uk/release/trunk}}
\end{DoxyCode}
 and the update is done with the command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{tsocks svn update}
\end{DoxyCode}
 We are grateful to Chris Bertram from the University of Sydney for this information.
