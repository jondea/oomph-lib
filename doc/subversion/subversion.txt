\section problems Troubleshooting
If the response to the checkout or update commands is 
\code
svn: Can't connect to host 'oomph-lib.maths.man.ac.uk': Network unreachable
\endcode
despite the fact that your web browser is working, say, the likely problem 
is that your network commands are being intercepted by a proxy server, 
and you are using a version of the subversion software
that does not have proxy settings for the svn protocol.
(Subversion can also use the http and https protocols, but these are
not serviced by our repository. Therefore the response to the command
\code
svn checkout http://oomph-lib.maths.man.ac.uk/release/trunk 
\endcode
will be 
\code 
svn: Server sent unexpected return value (400 Bad Request) in response to OPTIONS request
for 'http://oomph-lib.maths.man.ac.uk/release/trunk'
\endcode

The solution is to install tsocks (if you don't have it already 
on your computer). If you are running Ubuntu or
another Debian derivative, the appropriate command is
\code
apt-get install tsocks
\endcode 
Edit the IP addresses in \c /etc/tsocks.conf to refer to your 
local domain and proxy server (you may need to ask
your local network administrator for information). The checkout is 
then effected by issuing the command
\code
tsocks svn checkout svn://oomph-lib.maths.man.ac.uk/release/trunk
\endcode 
and the update is done with the command
\code
tsocks svn update
\endcode
We are grateful to Chris Bertram from the University of Sydney
for this information.
