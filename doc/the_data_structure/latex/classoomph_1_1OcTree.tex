\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1OcTree}{Oc\+Tree}} class\+: Recursively defined, generalised octree.

An \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1OcTree}{Oc\+Tree}} has\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a pointer to the object (of type \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1RefineableQElement_3_013_01_4}{Refineable\+Q\+Element$<$3$>$}}) it represents
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1Vector}{Vector}} of pointers to its eight (L\+DB,R\+DB,...,R\+UF) sons (which are octrees themselves). If the \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1Vector}{Vector}} of pointers to the sons has zero length, the \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1OcTree}{Oc\+Tree}} is a \char`\"{}leaf node\char`\"{} in the overall octree.
\item a pointer to its father. If this pointer is N\+U\+LL, the \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1OcTree}{Oc\+Tree}} is the the root node of the overall octree. This data is stored in the \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1Tree}{Tree}} base class.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The tree can also be part of a forest. If that is the case, the root will have pointers to the roots of neighbouring octrees.

The objects contained in the octree are assumed to be (topologically) cubic elements whose geometry is parametrised by local coordinates $ {\bf s} \in [-1,1]^3 $.

The tree can be traversed while actions are being performed at all of its \char`\"{}nodes\char`\"{} or only at the leaf \char`\"{}nodes\char`\"{}.

Finally, the leaf \char`\"{}nodes\char`\"{} can be split depending on criteria defined by the object.

Note that Oc\+Trees are only generated by splitting existing Oc\+Trees. Therefore, the constructors are protected. The only \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1OcTree}{Oc\+Tree}} that \char`\"{}\+Joe User\char`\"{} can create is the (derived) class \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1OcTreeRoot}{Oc\+Tree\+Root}}.

If an edge is bordered by the nodes whose local numbers are n1 and n2 in an element with nnode1d nodes along each coordinate direction, then this edge is shared by two faces. This function takes one of these faces as the argument {\ttfamily face} and returns the other one. ({\ttfamily face} is a direction in the set U,D,F,B,L,R). 

This function takes as argument two node numbers of two nodes delimiting an edge, and one face of this edge and returns the other face that is sharing this edge. The node numbers given to this function M\+U\+ST be vertices nodes to work. it also need the value of nnode1d to work. ({\ttfamily face} is a direction in the set U,D,F,B,L,R).

Find (pointer to) `greater-\/or-\/equal-\/sized true edge neighbour' in the given direction (LB,RB,DB,UB \mbox{[}the back edges\mbox{]}, LD,RD,LU,RU \mbox{[}the side edges\mbox{]}, LF,RF,DF,UF \mbox{[}the front edges\mbox{]}). 

Another way of interpreting this is that we\textquotesingle{}re looking for the neighbour across the present element\textquotesingle{}s edge \textquotesingle{}direction\textquotesingle{}. The various arguments return additional information about the size and relative orientation of the neighbouring octree. Each edge of the element that is represented by the octree is parametrised by one (of the three) local coordinates that parametrise the entire 3D element. E.\+g. the L\mbox{[}eft\mbox{]}B\mbox{[}ack\mbox{]} edge is parametrised by s\mbox{[}1\mbox{]}; the \char`\"{}low\char`\"{} vertex of this edge (located at the low value of this coordinate, i.\+e. at s\mbox{[}1\mbox{]}=-\/1) is L\mbox{[}eft\mbox{]}D\mbox{[}own\mbox{]}B\mbox{[}ack\mbox{]}. The \char`\"{}high\char`\"{} vertex of this edge (located at the high value of this coordinate, i.\+e. at s\mbox{[}1\mbox{]}=1) is L\mbox{[}eft\mbox{]}U\mbox{[}p\mbox{]}B\mbox{[}ack\mbox{]}; etc

The interpretation of the arguments is as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In a forest, an \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1OcTree}{Oc\+Tree}} can have multiple edge neighbours (across an edge where multiple trees meet). {\ttfamily i\+\_\+root\+\_\+edge\+\_\+neighbour} specifies which of these is used. Use this as \char`\"{}reverse communication\char`\"{}\+: First call with {\ttfamily i\+\_\+root\+\_\+edge\+\_\+neighbour=0} and {\ttfamily n\+\_\+root\+\_\+edge\+\_\+neighour} initialised to anything you want (zero, ideally). On return from the fct, {\ttfamily n\+\_\+root\+\_\+edge\+\_\+neighour} contains the total number of true edge neighbours, so additional calls to the fct with {\ttfamily i\+\_\+root\+\_\+edge\+\_\+neighbour$>$0} can be made until they\textquotesingle{}ve all been visited.
\item The vector {\ttfamily translate\+\_\+s} turns the index of the local coordinate in the present octree into that of the neighbour. If there are no rotations then {\ttfamily translate\+\_\+s}\mbox{[}i\mbox{]} = i.
\item The \char`\"{}low\char`\"{} vertex of the edge in the present octree coincides with a certain vertex in the edge neighbour. In terms of the neighbour\textquotesingle{}s local coordinates, this point is located at the (3D) local coordinates ({\ttfamily s\+\_\+lo}\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}, {\ttfamily s\+\_\+lo}\mbox{[}1\mbox{]}, {\ttfamily s\+\_\+lo}\mbox{[}2\mbox{]})
\item ditto with s\+\_\+hi\+: The \char`\"{}high\char`\"{} vertex of the edge in the present octree coincides with a certain vertex in the edge neighbour.

\item We\textquotesingle{}re looking for a neighbour in the specified {\ttfamily direction}. When viewed from the neighbouring octree, the edge that separates the present octree from its neighbour is the neighbour\textquotesingle{}s edge {\ttfamily edge}. If there\textquotesingle{}s no rotation between the two octrees, this is a simple reflection\+: For instance, if we\textquotesingle{}re looking for a neighhbour in the {\ttfamily DB} {\ttfamily direction}, {\ttfamily edge} will be {\ttfamily UF}.
\item {\ttfamily diff\+\_\+level} $<$= 0 indicates the difference in refinement levels between the two neighbours. If {\ttfamily diff\+\_\+level==0}, the neighbour has the same size as the current octree.
\end{DoxyItemize}{\bfseries{Important\+:}} We\textquotesingle{}re only looking for {\bfseries{true}} edge neighbours i.\+e. edge neigbours that are not also face neighbours.

Returns the vector of the coordinate directions of vertex node number n in an element with nnode1d element per dimension. 

This function is used to translate the position of a vertex node (given by his local number n into a vector giving the position of this node in the local coordinates system. It also needs the value of nnode1d to work.

Storage for the up/right-\/equivalents corresponding to two pairs of vertices along an element edge\+: 


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The first pair contains
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item the vertex in the reference element
\item the corresponding vertex in the edge neighbour (i.\+e. the vertex in the edge neighbour that is located at the same position as that first vertex).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The second pair contains
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item the vertex at the other end of the edge in the reference element
\item the corresponding vertex in the edge neighbour.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyItemize}These two pairs completely define the relative rotation between the reference element and its edge neighbour. The map returns a pair which contains the up\+\_\+equivalent and the right\+\_\+equivalent of the edge neighbour, i.\+e. it tells us which direction in the edge neighbour coincides with the up (or right) direction in the reference element. ~\newline
