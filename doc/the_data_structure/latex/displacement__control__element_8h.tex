\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Displacement control element\+: In the \char`\"{}normal\char`\"{} formulation of solid mechanics problems, the external load is given and the displacement throughout the solid body is computed. For highly nonlinear problems it is sometimes helpful to re-\/formulate the problem by prescribing the position of a selected control point and treating the (scalar) load level required to achieve this deformation as an unknown. As an example consider the buckling of pressure-\/loaded, thin-\/walled elastic shells. The load-\/displacement characteristics of such structures tend to be highly nonlinear and bifurcations from the structure\textquotesingle{}s pre-\/buckling state often occur via sub-\/critical bifurcations. If we have some a-\/priori knowledge of the expected deformation (for example, during the non-\/axisymmetric buckling of a circular cylindrical shell certain material points will be displaced radially inwards), it is advantageous to prescribe the radial displacement of a carefully selected control point and treat the external pressure as an unknown. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
