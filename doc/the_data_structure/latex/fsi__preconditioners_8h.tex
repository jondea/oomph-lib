\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em F\+SI preconditioner. This extracts upper/lower triangular blocks in the 3x3 overall block matrix structure arising from the monolithic discretisation of F\+SI problems with algebraic node updates. Dofs are decomposed into fluid velocity, pressure and solid unknowns. \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1NavierStokesSchurComplementPreconditioner}{Navier\+Stokes\+Schur\+Complement\+Preconditioner}} is used as the inexact solver for the fluid block; Super\+LU (in its incarnation as an \char`\"{}exact\char`\"{} preconditioner) is used for the solid block. By default we retain the fluid on solid off diagonal blocks. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em F\+SI preconditioner. This extracts upper/lower triangular blocks in the 3x3 overall block matrix structure arising from the monolithic discretisation of F\+SI problems with algebraic node updates. Dofs are decomposed into fluid velocity, pressure and solid unknowns. Blocks are then re-\/assembled into one global matrix and solved with a direct solver (Super\+LU in its incarnation as an exact preconditioner). By default we retain the fluid on solid off diagonal blocks. ~\newline
